# My Wedding Website

This website was specifically designed for our wedding invitees to gather information about the venue, dates, and conveniently purchase gifts for us, the bride and groom. 
Built with Next.js, Airtable, and Mercado Pago payment broker, it offers a seamless platform for guests to access wedding details and easily contribute through gift purchases.
